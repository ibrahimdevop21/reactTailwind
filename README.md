# Todo List

Welcome to the **Todo List** app, your new best friend in the battle against procrastination! 📝✨ This React-based app, built with the super-speedy Vite, is here to help you organize your life, one task at a time. With a splash of water wave animation to keep things groovy and todos that stick around even if you hit refresh, this app is as reliable as your favorite coffee shop.

## Features

- **Add Todos**: Drop new tasks into the list like magic.
- **Edit Todos**: Click to tweak your tasks—because we all make mistakes!
- **Delete Todos**: Say goodbye to tasks you’re done with (or just really don’t want to do).
- **Persistent Storage**: Your todos are saved in local storage, so you won’t lose them even if your cat decides to walk on your keyboard.
- **Responsive Design**: Looks great on phones, tablets, and even your old laptop.
- **Water Wave Animation**: A cool animated background to make your todo-ing just a little more fun.

import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react';

export default defineConfig({
